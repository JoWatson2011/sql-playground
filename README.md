## T-SQL
I used a SQL Server docker image from [dba tools](https://github.com/dataplat/dbatools/discussions/7972) to test commands and syntax. The database contained sales history and customer data for a fictional company. I used Azure Data Studio to connect to query the database and create new proceudures.
